⭕️ Requirements:
✅ Create a simple and clean landing page for a book catalog system using React and redux . The landing page should have a header, a list of the top 10 recently added books and a footer. There should be some open routes such as "All Books", "Sign In", and "Sign Up".

✅ Login Page and Registration Page: ( You can use firebase authentication or custom authentication)
✅ Create a way for users to create new accounts with a unique email and password. Also, create a way for users to log in using their credentials. After a successful login, the login button should be replaced with a logout button in the navbar. Create a way for users to securely log out of the application.

✅ All Books Page
Fetch a list of books from an API using RTK Query and Display the list of books (Table or card or any other manner). Each book should display key information such as

          Title
          Author
          Genre
          Publication Date   

❌ Implement a search bar that allows users to search for books based on criteria such as title, author, or genre.

🟡 Enable filtering options below or side of the search bar to narrow down the book list based on genre & publication year.

🟡 Ensure search and filtering operations are efficient and provide accurate results.

🟡 Implement an "Add New" Button to navigate to the "add-new-book" page to add a new book. You can also add "Add New Book" as a navigation menu for authenticated users.

🟡 Add New Book Page
Authenticated users can add a new book by filling out a form. After submitting the form, the user will be notified of the success or failure of the operation with a toast or other notification.

When a user clicks on a book from the list, displays a detailed view of the book. The detailed view should include the following information:

Title

Reviews
The reviews should be displayed on the book details page.

🟡 Add two buttons to the book details page:

Edit Button
Delete Button
When a user clicks on the Edit Book button, they should be redirected to the edit-book page. When a user clicks on the Delete Book button, they should see a confirmation dialogue to confirm that they want to delete the book.

🟡 Authenticated users should be able to leave reviews for books. Implement a submit box for submitting a review.

🟡 Edit Books Page:
